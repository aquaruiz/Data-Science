# Data Science
## Final Project

### Terms and conditions:
* Use Jupyter notebook for text and maths. You can use any programming language you would like.
* Write your research and code in English. Bulgarian is also acceptable but try to use English.
* If you have sensitive, copyrighted, or copy-protected assets, including but not limited to, images, multimedia, code, documents, and datasets,
  you can sign an NDA (non-disclosure agreement) with the SoftUni team. Contact the lecturer if you need assistance with the process.
* Any code which does not comply with the Bulgarian law (as of the exam date), will be given zero points.
* Any malicious code, or code intended to do harm to the user's computer, information, or privacy, will be given zero points.

By submitting your project for the exam, you agree with these terms and conditions.

**You are obliged** to use (and analyze) the 'World Food Facts' dataset located in the exam resources.

Other than that, you must use **at least two** additional, food- or health-related datasets.

Some ideas are listed below. You **are not required** to use these datasets. Find whatever is suitable for your task.
* Additional food information: nutritional facts, ratings, preferences, etc.
	* Recipe ingredients: https://www.kaggle.com/c/whats-cooking
	* Global food prices: https://www.kaggle.com/jboysen/global-food-prices
	* Global food & agriculture statistics: https://www.kaggle.com/unitednations/global-food-agriculture-statistics
* Data on people's food preferences, exercise, health, demographics, etc.
	* Food choices: https://www.kaggle.com/borapajo/food-choices
	* US healthcare data: https://www.kaggle.com/maheshdadhich/us-healthcare-data
* Additional data on people's habits and fitness
	* England obesity data: https://www.kaggle.com/fayomi/england%20obesity%20stats%202017
	* Foodborne disease outbreaks: https://www.kaggle.com/cdc/foodborne-diseases
	* Environment data: air quality, water quality, etc.
	* Social environment data: work stress, suicides, financial status, poverty, etc.
* Data on restaurants and menus:
	* Zomato restaurants data: https://www.kaggle.com/shrutimehta/zomato-restaurants-data
	* Fast food restaurants across America: https://www.kaggle.com/datafiniti/fast-food-restaurants
	
### Main points
* Select a question at the beginning and do your best to answer it
	* You don't need to have positive results in order to pass the exam. You need **some valid, repeatable results**
* Use data from different datasets in order to get multiple perspectives on your problem
	* Try to correlate the data sources. Even if the data are contradictory, this is still a valid result
* Perform a research. Use the scientific method and the principles of reproducible research
	* Present the results as you wish. Feel free to incorporate your own style of writing. Don't be afraid to show your character :)
* Write good, easy to read and maintain, code
	* Adhere to the Python code conventions
* Present your process and results clearly
